I am Yang Yu Hsiang. I majored in Geography and Environmental Resources at National Taiwan University, the top-ranked university in Taiwan, and then participated as an exchange student in the Geomorphological Analysis Laboratory at Tokyo Gakugei University. However, due to the outbreak of COVID-19, I returned to Taiwan and pursued a master's degree in the Department of Geographic Information Science at National Taiwan University. Additionally, I studied abroad as an exchange student at Kansai University for my master's thesis, where I improved my paper, submitted it for the Student Paper Award, and received the Excellence Award.

This field combines geography and IT, requiring the utilization of statistics and programming to explore problems and devise solutions. In my research lab, we conduct spatiotemporal analysis in the field of public health, and I tackled issues related to spatiotemporal numerical simulation of Dengue fever, an infectious disease.
